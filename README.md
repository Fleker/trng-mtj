# Software Design and Simulation of a Truly Random Number Generator using Memristors with Processing In-Memory

_Code related to research_

In order to complete the research related to the paper, I made modifications to two public repositories. Rather than include the entirety of both repos here, I have made the patches available.

You can add these patches to your fork of the project using [`git apply <filename>`](https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/using-patches-in-git/).

I recommend looking at the specific commits linked below just in case there are breaking changes that have occurred after my research concluded.
